**Build over 9 cross-platform desktop applications from scratch**

## What is this book about?
The Electron framework allows you to use modern web technologies to build applications that share the same code across all operating systems and platforms. This also helps designers to easily transition from the web to the desktop. Electron Projects guides you through building cross-platform Electron apps with modern web technologies and JavaScript frameworks such as Angular, React.js, and Vue.js.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Initialize Node.js, Node Package Manager (NPM), and JavaScript to set up your app
* Integrate Phaser with Electron to build a simple 2D game
* Improve app quality by adding an error tracking system and crash reports
* Implement group chat features and event handling capabilities using Firebase
* Integrate a WordPress-like rich-text editor into your app
* Build Electron applications using a single codebase
